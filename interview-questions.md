# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The parameter is a value placeholder that will be put into a function.  The argument is the actual input value to be used in the console.log

Researched answer: Parameters act as placeholders for variables which will be invoked by the function.  After being placed in the parentheses, they can be utilized throughout the logic.  Arguments is the actual data passed through function invocation.  Arguments have to be a data type that Javascript understands.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The .map method takes the predefined parameters that are value, which is required, index and array, which are optional.

Researched answer: The Higher Order Function .map method goes through, or iterates, the length of the array, or until conditions are met.  The three built-in, predefined parameters are: value, which is required, index, and array, in that order.  They can be named anything, but the order will remain that same.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: They both create new arrays.  However, .map retains the original array length, while .filter produces a new array length.

Researched answer: hey both create new arrays.  However, .map retains the original array length, while .filter produces a new array length. Filter requires an evaluation that produces a Boolean value.  True values are kept, while false values are excluded from the new array.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: An iteration is the process of a function evaluating the elements of an array.

Researched answer: Iterations perform actions throughout an entire block of code.  They are typically called upon when evaluating conditions that have a start and end point like in strings or arrays, for example.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Functions are reusable code that perform actions when called upon.

Researched answer: Functions are parts of code that, when called upon, perform action(s) that return an output.  They have placeholders for values called parameters, which actual data called arguments can be passed.  They can be used as many times as a program requires and should be deliberate in their descriptions while offering dynamic coding.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting brings a variable to the top of the code.

Researched answer: Variables that are used before they are declared.  Some declarations, like const and let, are rigid when it comes to their variable usage.  The const declaration restricts the variable from being redelcared anywhere in the logic.  Because of this, they can be called upon since there will be no confusion about what the variable "is" when being invoked in a function. Similarly, let variables may only be used within the function that invokes it.  Javascript will 'hoist' these declarations in order to prevent the code from breaking.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Classes: Classes work like functions.  They are the blueprints for objects and are resuable.

2. Spread operator: The use of ellipses as a reference to additional information.

3. React state: Determines how stored data behaves.

4. React props: Read only values that pass data flow in mutliple directions.

5. DOM events: Visual queues that occur when a user interacts with a website.
